# Stock Prediction with LSTM, Sentiment Analysis, and Reinforcement Learning

This project aims to predict stock prices for the next day using a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model in Python, supplemented by sentiment analysis of news. The approach combines:
- **Deep Learning**: Using LSTM for time-series stock price prediction.
- **Natural Language Processing**: Analyzing market-related news sentiment.
- **Reinforcement Learning**: Optimizing decisions for improved stock predictions.
